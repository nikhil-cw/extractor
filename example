            "description": "The Annapurna Base Camp Trek is an extraordinary adventure into the glacial heart of the western Himalayas.

The trail follows winding trails along forested slopes and treks alongside rushing rivers of surpassing beauty as we approach Annapurna Base Camp on this uniquely accessible six-day itinerary. It's an incredible combination of diverse cultures and nature. This trip is more than just a trek that we will never forget.

After enjoying a hearty breakfast, we’ll meet our driver and travel to a small village called Birethanti to collect our trekking permits. Then, we’ll drive a bit further to reach the trailhead at Siwai, which will take a total of about two hours on the road this morning. It’s all on foot from here, and our trek gets underway in earnest as we cross picturesque suspension bridges, hike past sparkling waterfalls, and cross alpine meadows where yaks graze, and Gurung villagers tend to crops of buckwheat and millet. As we approach our destination of Chhomrong or go a little further to Sinuwa, we’ll even start to enjoy some breathtaking views of snowcapped mountains. Chhomrong itself is a sprawling hillside village where you’ll meet plenty of friendly Gurung villagers as we settle into our accommodations. We’ll be staying at one of the local trekking lodges or teahouses. This is how overnight trekking is usually done in Nepal, and you’ll reap the rewards of a home-cooked meal and a warm place to sleep. Once we get checked in, you can relax in the village with a hot mug of tea as dusk gathers over the summits of Annapurna South, Hiunchuli, and the fishtail-shaped Machapuchare.",

After enjoying the marvelous view, we’ll begin our second day of trekking. Today’s trail starts with a stone staircase leading down for about an hour to the churning waters of the Chhomrong Khola River. We’ll cross a dramatic suspension bridge to reach the opposite bank before climbing the second series of stone stairs for another two hours. This will bring us to the little community of Sinuwa, where we’ll take a short break to soak in the tremendous view from 2,350 meters above sea level. The second portion of today’s hike brings us through a quiet forest of bamboo, oak, and rhododendron for approximately two hours. The flatter terrain in the dense woodland here will serve as a brief respite before we begin the steep ascent to the little villages known as Bamboo and Dovan. There, we’ll enjoy a well-earned hot meal and a good night’s sleep at one of the best guesthouses in town.",

Today's hike covers a distance of about 600 meters from Dovan to Deurali village. The first leg of the trek to the Himalayas involves a gentle climb through the lush forest of pines, oaks, and rhododendrons. We will encounter several stunning waterfalls along the way and eventually make our way to the Himalayan point, where we will encounter uphill sections leading to Dovan. The second leg of the trek would be 300 meters, which could take 1-2 hours to reach the camp. Along the way, we will also pass by the Hinco-Cave. Upon reaching Deurali, we can take a nice break, enjoy some snacks, and have a cup of hot tea while enjoying this beautiful scenery. Depending on your decisions, we may carry on to MBC. If you're interested in continuing to walk a little further, you can decide to climb to Machhapuchare base camp, which takes approximately 2 hours from Deurali, staying at MBC is so nice to see the great views of the Himalayan mountains. The view from MBC is truly spectacular. This will be a beautiful hike, with stunning views of Gangapurna, Annapurnas, Singachuli, and Macchupuchre throughout the entire walk.",

                    "description": "Today, we’ll earn the unique distinction of visiting not one but two mountaineering base camps. We’ll hit the trail right after breakfast, and we can expect to trek for about four hours in total. This is perhaps the most exciting day of our Himalayan adventure, and we’ll begin by climbing for two hours to the astounding natural amphitheater of mountains known as the Annapurna Sanctuary. This is where we’ll find Machapuchare Base Camp at an elevation of 3,700 meters. From here, you’ll get splendid views of Machapuchare, Gangapurna, and the entire Annapurna massif. After a short break for tea, we’ll continue across the dry moraine for two more hours and make the final push towards Annapurna Base Camp itself. The camp is situated at 4,130 meters in elevation, which represents the highest point on the entire Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek. The views here are nothing short of sublime: prayer flags are snapping in the wind, climbers and hikers are celebrating their achievements, and you’re completely surrounded by mountains. The panoramic vista from the base camp encompasses Machapuchare, Annapurna South, Annapurna III, Gandharva Chuli, and Gangapurna. But the star of the show is Annapurna I, stretching to an unbelievable 8,091 meters in height. We’ll spend the rest of the day at base camp enjoying the views and overnight at a nearby trekking lodge.",

We’ll linger over our breakfast to make the most of this phenomenon, taking plenty of time to bask in the unrivaled splendor of Annapurna Base Camp’s 360-degree Himalayan views. When you’re ready to move on, we’ll pack up our things and retrace our steps back to the village of Bamboo or the option to stand a little further to Sinuwa. As we pass idyllic homesteads and hike through alpine valleys and verdant woodlands, you’ll begin to appreciate how the trail presents an entirely different aspect when traveled in reverse. The terrain will also be somewhat easier to navigate now that we’ve begun our long descent from the high altitudes of base camp. After reaching Sinuwa, we’ll get checked in at another comfortable trekking lodge and have the afternoon and evening at our leisure.",

                    "description": "Our overland adventure continues in reverse this morning as we follow winding trails along with terraced fields and tread secluded paths through sun-dappled stands of oak and rhododendron. After passing through the familiar village of Chhomrong, we’ll take a steep detour to the popular Jhinu Danda hot springs. These natural spring-fed pools are a fantastic place to relax and let the stress of hiking melt away from your body. The pools are situated in the scenic river canyon of the Modi Khola, and we’ll stop here for some well-deserved rest and relaxation. After drying off, we’ll shoulder our packs once more and begin the final two-hour hike back to Siwai, where we first joined the trailhead at the start of our Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek. When we arrive in town, we’ll link up with a local taxi or bus to drive back to Pokhara. This last stretch of road takes between two and three hours to cover. Back in Pokhara, we’ll get checked in at our hotel, and we have plenty of time left to take a stroll in town, visit Lake Phewa, and dig into a sumptuous meal as the reward for all of our hard trekking. BTW, if you intend to travel back on the same day or the next day from Pokhara, then we will be happy to arrange free transport by tourist bus from Pokhara - Kathmandu. However you choose to travel, we’ve got one more evening of celebration and revelry in store for you. Our last night in the vibrant capital of Nepal serves as a great opportunity to experience some of the best traditional and cultural points of interest, which can be found here in Pokhara / Kathmandu. Some of the must-see religious attractions and other activities such as paragliding, bunjy jumping, and city tours in the cities are Pokhara and Kathmandu, including the most popular places like Boudhanath and Swayambhunath stupas, as well as Kathmandu Durbar Square. When you’ve had your fill of sightseeing, we’ll gather together for a farewell dinner at one of the best restaurants in town. Whether you’re departing Nepal tonight or spending another night in your hotel, remember that Alpine Ramble Treks provides complimentary transfers to Tribhuvan International Airport when it’s time to leave. Hosting your Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek has been our pleasure, and we hope you’ve had an unforgettable time in the western Himalayas. We can’t wait to welcome you back to Nepal!",
